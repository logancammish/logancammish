### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm 16

Most projects on here are for school, or were at least made during school. My contribution history usually follows this pattern.
If a repo is archived, it was likely a project made for school which was archived at the due date (however there may be exceptions).

I primarily use Rust for my projects as the language has proved to be an effective, memory-safe and low level programming language. I have also used to various extents: C, Javascript, Python and Lua

I have experience in Linux and have used Arch (or variations thereupon) as my primary repository on several occaisions, however due to hardware compatibility issues I have decided to switch back to Windows 11.
