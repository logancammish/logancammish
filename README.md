### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm 16

Most projects on here are for school, or were at least made during school. My contribution history usually follows this pattern.
If a repo is archived, it was likely a project made for school which was archived at the due date (however there may be exceptions).

I have used Arch Linux in the past, and currently use openSuse Tumbleweed due to stability issues with Arch.
